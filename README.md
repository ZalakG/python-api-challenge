Background
----------
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

Overview:
---------
- This challenge provided with the two different files, WeatherPy and VacationPy. The data has been manipulated using the API keys which has been generated for the assignment purpose. 

WeatherPy:

- In this file the visulization of weather accross the cities has done using city Python librarya and OpenWeatherMap API.
- This file contains different plots and linear Regression to showcase the realationship between Weather variables(Temperature, Humidy, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed) and Latitude.

VacationPy:

- In this file visulization has done using geoViews Python library and the Geoapify API.
- The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in WeatherPy is provided to help to get started.
- Maps have been created to display a point for every city in the DataFrame. The DataFrames have been narrow down to mach the ideal criteria to search the nearest hotels to plan the vacation.
